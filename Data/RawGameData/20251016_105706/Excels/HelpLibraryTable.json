      "Q: How to catch up in level? <br>A: The main source of EXP is <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Story Quests]</style> and daily <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Activity]</style> rewards in the Season Hub. Other [Quests] also grant EXP. The daily <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Activity]</style> EXP is stored in the <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Unclaimed EXP Pool]</style>, and future EXP gains will be doubled until you've caught up. The level cap for Season 1 is 60. Returning Adventurers can quickly catch up through daily activity and main story quests. <br><br>Q: How to recover lost resources? <br>A: During your absence, the system will store missed <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Daily Activity Rewards]</style>, contents from the <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Honor Coin Store]</style>, <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Unstable Space]</style>, <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Stimen Vaults]</style>, overflowed Elite/Boss Loot Keys, and overflowed Focus. After returning, you can go to <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Season Hub - Activity]</style> and access the Reclaim Hub at the bottom left to recover them. Recovering resources helps you quickly catch up in strength. <br><br>Q: How to improve strength after returning? <br>A: Use <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Unclaimed EXP]</style> to quickly catch up on Adventurer Level, and retrieve resources from the <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Reclaim Hub]</style>. Then, use <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Alloy Shards]</style> to exchange for gear, and enhance it using recovered Reforge Stones and refining materials. Use recovered skill books and Imprint materials to develop your skills and talents, boosting your strength. <br><style=\"GuideBookLab1\">Tips</style>: For more detailed progression guidance, refer to the <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Must-Read for Novice]</style> section. <br><br>Q: Can I participate in gameplay before catching up in strength? <br>A: Most gameplay modes that provide resources can be completed solo and do not require high strength. Examples include: Daily Missions, Unstable Space, Field Elite/Boss hunts, and Life Skills. In addition, as the season progresses, Chaotic Realm will offer AI Assistance mode for various difficulties to help Adventurers continue progressing in gear. Meanwhile, once strength improves, Stimen Vaults can also be challenged at higher floors (solo challenge allowed). Overall, after returning, Adventurers can participate in most content through solo activity and gradually catch up with the main group to resume regular play. <br><style=\"GuideBookLab1\">Tips</style>: For information on Adventurer Level, proression systems, earning money, currencies, and key stores, please check the <style=\"GuideBookLab1\">[Must-Read for Novice]</style> section."
